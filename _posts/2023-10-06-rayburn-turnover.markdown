Rayburn Trading, a company with a seven-decade history of dedication and commitment, is pleased to announce the achievement of a significant milestone – surpassing £100 million in turnover. This accomplishment underscores the enduring values and consistent work ethic that define the organization!

Established by Benny Goldman 70 years ago, Rayburn Trading embarked on its journey with modest beginnings. Benny's vision was founded on principles of hard work, integrity, and community values. While Benny is no longer with us to witness this achievement, his legacy remains an integral part of the company.

Reflecting on this milestone, Rayburn Trading's Director, Howard Goldman, remarked, "My grandad, Benny, founded Rayburn Trading seven decades ago as a small enterprise, characterized by dedication, integrity, and a strong sense of community. Though he did not witness our transformation into what we are today, I believe he would take pride in our collective achievements."

In recent years, Rayburn Trading not only navigated the challenges posed by a pandemic but also demonstrated resilience and growth. Substantial investments in infrastructure, including the acquisition of a state-of-the-art warehouse, have significantly expanded the organization's storage capacity. The company's commitment to innovation extends to the introduction of new product lines in skincare, cosmetics, and fragrances. Most recently, the implementation of a night shift underscores the company's continued pursuit of expansion.

This accomplishment signifies more than financial success. It is a tribute to Rayburn Trading's enduring spirit, unwavering values, and the dedication of every member within the Rayburn family. Together, they have reached a significant milestone, with the £100 million turnover marking only the beginning of an exciting journey that lies ahead.
