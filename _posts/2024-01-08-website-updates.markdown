    </h2>
    <p>
    We've added two new sort options to the website, you can now sort by <span class="font-bold">Newest</span> to see the latest products added to the website in that category, or <span class="font-bold">Most Popular</span> to see the most popular products in that category based on Rayburn's last 30 days of sales.
    <br /><br />
    <span class="font-bold">Don't miss out on our best sellers, they're popular for a reason!</span>

    <h2>
        <span class="text-3xl text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-violet-600 to-indigo-600 bg-clip-text"> Last Bought</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
    Sort by Last Bought to see the products you've bought from us most recently in that category, this is a great way to quickly find the products you've bought before and are looking to buy again.
    <br /><br />
    <span class="font-bold">Try sorting by oldest to see lines you've not bought for a while, great way to check for Back In Stocks!</span>

        View PLOF</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
    If you go to your My Account page we've added a View PLOF button that will take you to a brand new section with every active product you've ever ordered. This is a great way to see all the products you've bought from us in one place, either split by category or all together!
    <br /><br />
    <span class="font-bold">
    Top Tip: You can add your entire previous order to your basket in one click from the My Account page too!</span>
